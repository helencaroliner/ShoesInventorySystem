## Introduction

This code is a Python project for an inventory management system. It provides a text-based interface for the user to interact with and perform various tasks on a database of shoes.




## Program functions

The project starts by defining a Shoe class that stores the details of each shoe, such as the country of origin, product code, name, cost, and quantity. The shoe_list stores all the shoes in the inventory. The project provides various functions to read the shoes' data from a text file, add new shoes to the inventory, view all shoes in a table format, re-stock a shoe with the lowest quantity, search for a specific shoe, calculate the total value of each item, and find the product with the highest quantity for sale.

The project uses the tabulate library to display the shoe data in a table format. It also writes the updated shoe quantity to the original text file after restocking a shoe. The code defines a while loop that presents a menu to the user and waits for input. The user can select any option from the menu to perform the corresponding function. The loop continues until the user chooses to quit.




## Conclusion

The project can be useful for a small business that deals with shoes. It provides an easy-to-use interface to keep track of inventory and perform various tasks, such as adding new shoes, restocking low-quantity shoes, and finding the most popular products.
